# Biological sequence analysis

More information about this project is in "Sprawozdanie PDF.pdf" (only in Polish).

An interactive Python language program with a graphical user interface. It downloads several functions including downloading pre-selected sequences in FASTA or Genbank format by their ID number or loading local files. In addition, the program allows showing the entire chain of nucleotides or amino acids and calculating their number, the number of amino acid pairs and nucleotide triplets. Its last feature is the comparison of two nucleotides ("origin" and "CDS") and/or amino acid sequences.

The program has a GUI written using the wxPython package. Additional functions were implemented from re and Biopython packages. All of them are necessary for installation to run the program.
